                    <p>I am writing in response to the above-referenced notice dated April 15, 2025, which assessed a penalty for late filing of my 2024 Form 1120. I respectfully request that this penalty be abated based on my eligibility for First Time Penalty Abatement relief.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="mb-3">
                    <p>I have been in business since 2019 and have a history of timely filing and paying all required tax returns and payments. Prior to this instance, I have never been assessed a penalty related to my tax filings. This late filing was due to extraordinary circumstances beyond my control, as detailed below:</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="mb-3">
                    <p>In January 2025, I experienced a significant computer system failure that resulted in the loss of key financial records needed to complete my tax return. Despite immediate efforts to recover and reconstruct these records, including hiring specialized data recovery services, the process took longer than anticipated and prevented me from meeting the filing deadline.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="mb-3">
                    <p>Upon recovering the necessary data, I promptly completed and filed my return. I have since implemented additional backup systems to ensure this situation does not recur. My late filing was not due to willful neglect, but rather due to circumstances beyond my reasonable control.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="mb-4">
                    <p>Based on my history of compliance and the reasonable cause circumstances described above, I respectfully request that the penalties assessed in your notice be abated. If you need any additional information to process this request, please contact me at (555) 123-4567 or email@example.com.</p>
