I need you to integrate this compact CSS styling into my .fylr tax platform to fix scaling and spacing issues. The current site is too large at 100% zoom with excessive padding, especially in the hero section.

TASK: Apply the provided CSS overrides to make the platform more compact and professional without breaking existing functionality or design.

CURRENT ISSUES TO FIX:
- Site too large at 100% zoom (needs 80% to be usable)
- Excessive hero section padding wasting screen space
- Navigation bar too tall (~64px, should be ~50px)
- Cards and panels have too much spacing
- Buttons and form elements are oversized
- Poor screen space utilization throughout

REQUIREMENTS:
✅ Integrate the compact CSS file I'm providing
✅ Ensure it loads AFTER existing CSS (Bootstrap/Tailwind) to override defaults
✅ Maintain all existing functionality and interactions
✅ Preserve dark theme and orange accent colors (#FF6B00)
✅ Keep mobile responsiveness working properly
✅ Don't break any existing components or layouts
✅ Maintain accessibility (focus states, minimum touch targets)
✅ Test all major user flows still work

INTEGRATION APPROACH:
1. Add the CSS file to your project structure
2. Include it in HTML head AFTER main stylesheets
3. Verify loading order: Bootstrap/Tailwind → Main CSS → Compact CSS
4. Test all pages and components work correctly
5. Check mobile view remains functional

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- Hero section dramatically more compact (reduce padding by 60-70%)
- Navigation height reduced from ~64px to 50px
- Overall font scale reduced from 16px to 14px base
- Cards, buttons, forms more proportionally sized
- Better screen space utilization at 100% zoom
- Professional, dense interface like Stripe Dashboard
- Maintained readability and usability

CSS FILE TO INTEGRATE:
[I'm providing the complete CSS file - implement it exactly as written]

DO NOT:
❌ Modify the core CSS variables or spacing system
❌ Change color schemes or theme
❌ Break existing component functionality
❌ Remove accessibility features
❌ Alter mobile responsiveness
❌ Override with conflicting styles

VERIFY AFTER INTEGRATION:
- All navigation links work
- Forms submit properly
- Buttons remain clickable
- Chat interfaces function
- Mobile view isn't broken
- Cards display correctly
- Typography hierarchy maintained

Focus on clean integration that immediately improves space utilization while preserving all existing functionality. The goal is a more professional, dense interface that feels like premium SaaS software.
