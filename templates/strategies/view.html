                <p>Based on your responses, you may be eligible for an expanded home office deduction. This strategy involves properly calculating the percentage of your home used for business and maximizing all related expenses.</p>
                <p>The home office deduction is available for both homeowners and renters, and applies to all types of homes. For your business profile as a technology consultant working primarily from home, this deduction represents one of the most accessible tax benefits available.</p>
