# Understanding Upgrade Prompts in .fylr

## What Are Upgrade Prompts?

Upgrade prompts are helpful notifications that appear at strategic points during your tax preparation journey with .fylr. These prompts identify when your business might benefit from features available in higher-tier plans.

Unlike generic upsells, these prompts are triggered by specific aspects of your business situation that indicate you could benefit from additional features.

## When Do Upgrade Prompts Appear?

Upgrade prompts appear at logical trigger points in your tax preparation process:

### Entity Type Requirements

**When**: During business profile setup or when changing your entity type
**Why**: S Corporations and C Corporations have complex tax requirements that need at least the Guided plan

When you select S Corp or C Corp as your entity type while on the Self-Service plan, you'll see a prompt explaining that these entity types require more advanced features due to their complexity.

### High Revenue Detection

**When**: After entering business financial information
**Why**: Businesses with higher revenue typically have more complex tax situations and greater opportunities for tax optimization

If your business reports revenue over $150,000, the system recognizes the increased complexity and potential for significant tax savings available in higher-tier plans.

### Multi-State Operations

**When**: When indicating operation in multiple states
**Why**: Filing requirements across multiple states create compliance challenges that benefit from advanced features

If you indicate that your business operates in more than one state, the system will suggest features that help manage multi-state filing requirements.

### Employee/Contractor Management

**When**: After indicating you have employees or contractors
**Why**: Employment tax requirements introduce additional compliance needs

When you indicate having employees or independent contractors, the system recognizes the added complexity in tax filings and suggests relevant features.

### Document Incompleteness

**When**: During document upload when gaps are detected
**Why**: Missing or incomplete documentation increases audit risk

If the system detects potential gaps in your documentation, it will suggest features that help ensure compliance and reduce audit risk.

### High Audit Risk Factors

**When**: When certain audit risk factors are detected in your profile or documents
**Why**: Some business activities or deductions have higher audit risk profiles

The system analyzes your business activities for patterns that might increase audit risk and suggests protection features when appropriate.

## What Information Is Included in Upgrade Prompts?

Each upgrade prompt includes:

1. **Clear Explanation**: Why this specific feature would benefit your situation
2. **Available Features**: What additional capabilities you'd gain with an upgrade
3. **Price Difference**: Transparent information about the cost difference
4. **Recommendation Type**: Whether it's essential (e.g., entity requirements) or optional (optimization opportunities)
